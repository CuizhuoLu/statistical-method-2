Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
•Develop a thorough grounding in modern methods for linear models and extensions of linear models
especially as they related to the designed experiments.
•Develop an understanding of concepts and relevant theory and ability to design and analyze experi-
ments.
•Develop the practical skills to analyze designed experiments with R software.
Course Description
Provides a thorough grounding in modern statistical methods. The specific learning outcomes for the course
are to understand data collection in context (how/why data were collected, key questions under study);
explore data by effective graphical and numerical summaries; understand probability concepts and models
as tools for studying random phenomena and for statistical inference; analyze data using appropriate, modern
statistical models, methods, and software; understand the statistical concepts underlying methods; develop
the ability to interpret results and critically evaluate the methods used; communicate data analysis and key
findings in context.
